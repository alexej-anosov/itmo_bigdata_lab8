river flowing under the bright moon
stars shining in the dark sky
trees whisper in the gentle wind
sun rising over the green hills
birds singing in the morning light
clouds drifting across the blue sky
rain falling on the quiet forest
flowers bloom in the warm sun
waves crashing on the sandy shore
leaves rustle in the cool breeze
